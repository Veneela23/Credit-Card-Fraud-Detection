## Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored dataset (`creditcard_sample.csv` - sample for GitHub).
2. Checked missing values, class distribution, and summary statistics.
3. Visualized fraud vs non-fraud transactions, correlations, and transaction amount patterns.
4. Used SQL queries to summarize fraud vs non-fraud statistics.
5. Created a Power BI dashboard to present fraud patterns and high-risk transaction periods.
